### Moving Average Crossover
-------------------------------------------------


The moving average (MA) is a simple technical analysis tool that smooths out price data by creating a constantly updated average price. The average is taken over a specific period of time, like 10 days, 50 days, 200 days or any time period the trader chooses.

Moving average crossover is a strategy to apply when two moving averages on a chart: one longer and one shorter cross over each other. When the shorter-term MA crosses above the longer-term MA, it's a buy signal, as it indicates that the trend is shifting up. This is known as a "golden cross."

We will be using 10 day moving average as shorter-term MA and 50 day moving averages as longer-term MA. 

```python
aapl['MA10'] = aapl['Close'].rolling(10).mean()
aapl['MA50'] = aapl['Close'].rolling(50).mean()
aapl.head(2)
```

Here "aapl" is daily OHLC data of Apple stock.  

The tutorial of how to use moving average is explained in the file [**'notebook/Moving_average_crossover.ipynb'**](https://github.com/abbi163/moving_average_crossover/blob/master/notebook/Moving_average_crossover.ipynb). 

Python script where moving average crossover strategy is applied to all the data is given in [**Moving_average_crossover.py**](https://github.com/abbi163/moving_average_crossover/blob/master/Moving_average_crossover.py)

### Data Collection of S&P 500 stocks!
-------------------------------------------------

For data collection we will be using yfinance module. 
To install it we will be using following bash command

```bash
pip install yfinance
```

yfinance need stock ticker symbol, start date and end data to download the OHLC, adusted close and volume data. 

```python
import yfinance
symbol = 'AAPL'
start_date = '2019-01-01'
end_date = '2020-06-01'
stock_data = yfinance.download( symbol, 
                                start = start_date, 
                                end = end_date, 
                                progress=False)
```

The tutorial of how to use collect stock data is explained in the file [**'notebook/S&P500_data.ipynb'**](https://github.com/abbi163/moving_average_crossover/blob/master/notebook/S%26P500_data.ipynb). 

Python script where S&P500 data is downloaded for all the [stock tickers](https://github.com/abbi163/moving_average_crossover/blob/master/S%26P500_ticker.csv) is given here [**S&P500_data.py**](https://github.com/abbi163/moving_average_crossover/blob/master/S%26P500_data.py)

### Result 
----------------------------

Finally the result of net wealth and wealth ratio for all the stocks are save in [Stock_gain_loss](https://github.com/abbi163/moving_average_crossover/tree/master/Stock_gain_loss) folder as csv files for given year.
